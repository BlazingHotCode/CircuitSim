# CircuitSim 1.1.1

## Fixes

- Custom components now simulate correctly on the main board (logic gates inside custom components are included in the simulation expansion, and logic signals propagate through the expanded wiring).
- Autosave now correctly restores custom components on startup (custom definitions embedded in the autosave are cached and used as a fallback during load, and autosave loading happens after custom resolvers are configured).

## Notes

- `dist/manifest.txt` version bumped to `1.1.1`.
- Built artifact: `dist/CircuitSim-1.1.1.jar`.
