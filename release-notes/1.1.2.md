# CircuitSim 1.1.2

## Added

- Double-click custom components to open the editor.
- Wire endpoints connected to component connection points now follow the component when moved/resized/rotated.
- Shift-drag a component to move it without dragging attached wires.

## Fixed

- Improved stability of SR latch / flip-flop style feedback circuits in custom components.

## Notes
