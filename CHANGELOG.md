# Changelog

## 1.1.3 - 2026-01-28

### Changed
- Internal refactor to improve maintainability (CircuitPanel and CircuitSim structure).
- No intended user-facing behavior changes.

## 1.1.2 - 2026-01-27

### Added
- Double-click a custom component to open its editor.
- Wires attached to connection points now follow components when moved/resized/rotated.
- Hold Shift while dragging a component to move it without dragging attached wires.

### Fixed
- Custom-component editor output indicators now update reliably (no “click to refresh” behavior).
- SR latch / flip-flop behavior in custom components is more stable on startup.
